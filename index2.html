        <strong>What is Python?</strong>
        <p>
            Is an interpreted, high-level,
            general-purpose programming language. 
            Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, 
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable
            use of significant whitespace. 
            Its language constructs and object-oriented 
            approach aim to help programmers write clear, 
            logical code for small and large-scale projects.

            <strong>A little bit of history.</strong>
            <div>
                Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum 
                at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
                in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),
                capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.</aside>
